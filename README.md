# 📊 Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project  

## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project analyzes sales data for a retail business using SQL. The goal was to extract key insights about customer behavior, product performance, and revenue trends by querying a structured database. The project demonstrates my ability to write and optimize SQL queries to answer real-world business questions.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- 🗄️ **SQL Database** (PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQLite)  
- 🔍 **SQL Queries** (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, Aggregate Functions)  

## 📂 Database Schema  
The dataset consists of three key tables:  

- 👤 **Customers**: Contains customer information such as name, email, and signup date.  
- 🏷️ **Products**: Stores product details including name, category, and price.  
- 🛒 **Orders**: Tracks purchases made by customers, including quantity and order date.  

## 📊 Business Questions Answered  
As part of the project, I wrote SQL queries to answer critical business questions, including:  

1️⃣ **How many customers signed up in 2023?**  
2️⃣ **What are the details of each order, including customer and product information?**  
3️⃣ **What is the total revenue generated from sales?**  
4️⃣ **How many orders has each customer placed?**  
5️⃣ **Which product is the best seller?**  

## 🚀 Key Takeaways  
- ✅ **Data Extraction**: Used SELECT and WHERE clauses to filter relevant data.  
- ✅ **Data Joins**: Leveraged JOINs to combine information from multiple tables for comprehensive insights.  
- ✅ **Aggregation & Analysis**: Applied SUM, COUNT, and GROUP BY to summarize key business metrics.  
- ✅ **Optimization**: Ensured efficient queries by structuring data retrieval effectively.  

## 🏆 What I Learned  
This project reinforced my understanding of relational databases, query optimization, and how data-driven decisions impact business strategy. It also helped me practice breaking down real-world business needs into SQL queries.  

## 📢 Next Steps  
To expand this project, I plan to:  
🔹 Integrate more advanced SQL techniques, such as **window functions** and **CTEs**.  
🔹 Explore data visualization tools like **Tableau or Power BI** to enhance insights.  
🔹 Work with a **larger dataset** to analyze long-term trends.
